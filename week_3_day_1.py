# # Working With Strings


# # 1.   Working With Numbers
# # 2.   Getting Input From Users




# # 1.   Building a Basic Calculator
# # 2.   Mad Libs Game




































# # Review
# create variables for the following :
# 1. age
# age=16
# # 2. name
# name="nathan denis"
# # 3. song
# song="can we be friends?"
# # 4. food
# food="steak tacos"
# # 5. number
# number=1000000

# # #now include the variables you just made print in the following...


# # Once upon a time, there was a [age] old coder named [name].
# print("once upon a time there was a " + str(age) + " old coder named " + name )

# # [name] liked to hum the song [song] while coding. It was so annoying that their teammates would throw [food] until [name] would stop singing.
# print(name + " liked to hum the song "+ song +" while coding.  It was so annoying, that their teammates would throw " + food +" until " + name + " would stop")

# # Still, [name] was the best coder on the team and could write [number] lines of code every day. Maybe [song] was [name]â€™s secret power?
# print(f"Still,{name} was the best coder on the team and could write {number} lines of code every day.  Maybe {song} was {name}'s secret power")

# The names you use when creating these labels need to follow a few rules:
# 1. Names can not start with a number.
# 2. There can be no spaces in the name, use _ instead.
# 3. Can't use any of these symbols :'",<>/?|\()!@#$%^&*~-+
# 4. It's considered best practice (PEP8) that names are lowercase.
# 5. Avoid using the characters 'l' (lowercase letter el), 'O' (uppercase letter oh),
#    or 'I' (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable names.
# 6. Avoid using words that have special meaning in Python like "list" and "str"


# Here are some exercises to practice the rules:


# Correcting Invalid Names: Below are some invalid names. Correct them according to the rules:


# # 1st_name
# first_name="nathan"
# # last name
# last_name="Denis"
# # email@address
# email_adress="ndenis@cps.edu"
# # variable#name
# variable_name
# # O
# zero=zero
# # list
# # Creating Valid Names: Create valid names for the following descriptions:


# The first name of a person
# The last name of a person
# The email address of a person
# The percentage of marks obtained by a student
# A variable to store the number of items in a shopping cart




# Identify Valid and Invalid Names: Identify which of the following names are valid or invalid according to the rules:


# first_name
# last_name
# email_address
# percentage
# variable_name
# first_varible 
# email_adress
# percent
# illnois

# # **Working with** **numbers** **bold text**
# We'll learn about the following topics:
# 1. Types of Numbers in Python
# 2. Basic Arithmetic
# 3. Differences between classic division and floor division


# Python has various "types" of numbers (numeric literals).
# 1. We'll mainly focus on integers and floating point numbers.
# Integers are just whole numbers, positive or negative. For example: 2 and -2 are examples of integers.
# 2. Floating point numbers in Python are notable because they have a decimal point in them, or use an exponential (e) to define the number. For example 2.0 and -2.1 are examples of floating point numbers. 4E2 (4 times 10 to the power of 2) is also an example of a floating point number in Python.

# #addition
# print(2+2) # adds 2 numbers
# # #multiplication
# print(2*2) # multiplies 2 numbers
# # #division
# print(4/2) # divides 2 numbers 
# # #modulo
# print(2%2)
# # #powers
# print(2**2)
# # #get the max and min of a number
# print(max(2,3))
# print(min(2,3))
# # #round a number
# print(round(2.5))
# # # absolute value
# print(abs(-2))
# # # order of operations
# print(2 + 10 *10  + 3)
# # to do more you need to import special math libraries from python
# from math import *    
# # #this goes out and grabs some different math functions we can use
# # #floor method
# print(floor(3.7))
# print(floor(3.9))
# # #ceil method
# print(ceil(3.7))
# print(ceil(3.3))
# # #sqrt method
# print(sqrt(36))

# So what have we learned? We learned some of the basics of numbers in Python. We also learned how to do arithmetic and use Python as a basic calculator. We then wrapped it up with learning about Variable Assignment in Python.
# # **Getting Input from users**
# #how do we get input from users?
# input("what is your name?")
# # basic math calculator
# #ask the user for 2 numbers
# # print out a statement where you:
# # add them together
# #multiply
# # find the max number
# # find the remainder of the numbers
# #round one number

name=input("name:")

print("hello " + name)

print("this is a calulator")

num_1=int(input("what is your first number:"))
num_2= int(input("what is your second number:"))
print("addition: " +str( num_1 + num_2))
print("multiplication: " +str( num_1 * num_2))
print("divison: " +str( num_1 / num_2))
print("max: " +str(max(num_1,num_2) ))
print("remainder: " + str(num_1 % num_2))
print("round: " + str(round(num_1)) + ", " + str( round(num_2)))
